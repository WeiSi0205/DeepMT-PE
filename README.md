# Leveraging Deep Learning for Machine Translation in Analyzing Psychological Factors in Physical Education and Sport

## Overview

Machine translation has become a critical component of natural language processing, leveraging deep learning to improve semantic and syntactic alignment across different languages. Despite its progress, challenges remain, particularly for low-resource languages, domain variability, and contextual ambiguity.

This project introduces a novel framework that incorporates:

- **Dynamic Attention Mechanism** – Captures multi-granular linguistic features and long-distance dependencies.
- **Hierarchical Encoding** – Enhances language representation through structured encoding.
- **Cross-Lingual Alignment Module** – Facilitates knowledge transfer between languages to improve translation quality in low-resource settings.
- **Context-Aware Training Strategy** – Includes dynamic curriculum learning, adaptive domain adaptation, and uncertainty-driven optimization.

Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in translation accuracy, fluency, and domain adaptability, establishing a state-of-the-art approach for machine translation in sports psychology and physical education contexts.

## Features

- **Improved Translation for Low-Resource Languages**  
  Enhances translation performance through cross-lingual knowledge transfer.

- **Dynamic Curriculum Learning**  
  Optimizes the learning process by adjusting training complexity dynamically.

- **Adaptive Domain Adaptation**  
  Ensures robust translation across different domains by fine-tuning model parameters.

- **Uncertainty-Driven Optimization**  
  Mitigates translation errors by refining model confidence in ambiguous contexts.
